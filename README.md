# Guess your polynomial

Secretly pick a polynomial in one variable with nonnegative integer coefficients. Then answer just two questions and watch as your polynomial is read back to you! It's not magic, it's maths.

```
$ python guess.py  
What is f(1)? 4
What is f(5)? 56
Your polynomial is: 

	1 + 1 x^1 + 2 x^2

```
